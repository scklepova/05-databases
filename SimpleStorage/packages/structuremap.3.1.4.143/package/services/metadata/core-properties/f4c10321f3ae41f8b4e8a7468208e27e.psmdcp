StructureMap can enable looser coupling between classes and their dependencies, improve the testability of a class structure, and provide generic flexibility mechanisms. Used judiciously, StructureMap can greatly enhance the opportunities for code reuse by minimizing direct coupling between classes and configuration mechanisms.</dc:description><dc:identifier>structuremap</dc:identifier><version>3.1.4.143</version><dc:language>en-US</dc:language><keywords /></coreProperties>
